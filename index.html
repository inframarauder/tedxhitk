                Neelanjana Sengupta, a computational biologist almost by
                accident. She had been a curious child who felt bothered unless
                she was able to grasp, at least conceptually, how ‘things
                worked’.<br /><br />
                She went on to study physics at the Bachelors and the Master's
                levels, majoring in Nuclear Physics in the latter. However, a
                half year stint in a theoretical polymer physics group at IISC
                Bangalore kindled a new interest in ‘soft matter’, which broadly
                encompasses research in systems susceptible to thermal
                fluctuations. Subsequently, she went on to earn her Ph.D. at the
                University of California, Irvine in the domain of computer
                simulations of biomolecular systems in 2008. <br /><br />
                Neelanjana Sengupta is currently serving the Department of
                Biological Sciences at IISER Kolkata in 2016 as a ‘computational
                biophysicist'. She is immensely grateful for the changing
                scientific landscape in the country that allows

                A keen learner,Shouvik spends his days trying to catch hold of
                hyper-excited law students running through the nooks and
                crannies of NUJS and makes them sit still long enough for him to
                learn from them the various finer aspects of financial laws.When
                he is not busy doing what he usually does, he tries to stay away
                from the One Ring, choose Hallows over Horcruxes and reminds
                himself that the Turtle floats and that the correct answer to
                life’s all questions is usually 42! <br /><br />
                Shouvik has authored till date several articles, notes and
